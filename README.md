#   Recruitment Hell Bingo
A satirical bingo card about the current state of Junior recruitment processes in tech.

This project is aimed at highlighting the absurdities and frustrations faced by junior developers during job hunting in 2026. It features an interactive bingo card filled with common experiences and phrases encountered in recruitment processes.

This project has been entirely vibed into existence by ChatGPT, I've merely curated its output so that all the cards presented would reflect personal experiences shared by myself or friends. If you have a suggestion for a card that you believe should be included, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

The only human-written code is the current README.md, the Helm chart configuration files, and the GitHub Actions workflow file. The application is hosted on my personal Kubernetes cluster and is available [here](https://bingos.casa/) as of January 2026.

##  Disclaimer
This project is intended for satirical and humorous purposes only. It does not aim to offend or target any specific individual or organisation. At the end of the day, we are all doing our best - as recruiters, hiring managers, or job seekers - to navigate a complex and often absurd system. I am sure that there would be potential for a similar bingo card from the perspective of recruiters about junior candidates.
